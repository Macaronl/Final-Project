(DISCLAIMER: THE IMAGES ARE NO LONGER PLACEHOLDERS.) I chose not to rename them since I didn't want to
break anything in the code and have to debug again.


This is a lite program that combines a Tic Tac Toe game with a quote generator. Each program and what they do are pretty self-explanatory.
I wanted to expand the image in the quote generator with the quotes but couldn't figure out how to and kept breaking the script so-
I just left it as is. Also, the font for the main menu changes when you choose "main menu" in the quote generator. The AI in the tic tac toe game is pretty basic and you'll have to try to lose in order to lose.
Overall, for one of my first coding classes, I'd say I did pretty decent. The program I wrote aside from the images are pretty decent and
function the way they're intended so I think it's a winner.
